# MineBench Privacy Policy

Effective and last updated: August 28, 2026

MineBench is an independent service operated by Ammaar Alam in the United States. This Privacy Policy explains how MineBench handles information when you use [minebench.ai](https://minebench.ai), participate in model evaluations, use MineBench's generation tools, or communicate with MineBench.

MineBench does not sell personal information or use it for targeted advertising. Additional terms may apply to a private evaluation or other service provided under an agreement.

## Information MineBench Collects

MineBench may collect:

- **Evaluation activity:** a pseudonymous session identifier, matchups shown, votes, timestamps, account association when you are signed in, and related evaluation data.
- **Content:** prompts, model selections, settings, imported files, model outputs, uploaded cohorts, builds, exports, and feedback you submit or generate.
- **Technical data:** IP address, request headers, browser and device information, IP-derived country, region, city, postal code, approximate coordinates, pages viewed, referrers, performance data, errors, and security events.
- **Account and organization data:** name, email address, sign-in provider, organization, invitations, role, permissions, authentication data, and evaluation requests if you create an account or work with MineBench.
- **Communications:** the category, title, message, optional reply email, and other information you provide through the contact form, support requests, emails, security reports, meetings, or other correspondence.

Public Arena voting does not require an account. Its session identifier distinguishes browser sessions but is not intended to identify you by name. If you sign in, MineBench associates unclaimed public votes from the current browser session with your account and associates later public votes while you remain signed in.

Supabase processes passwords and session credentials for MineBench. MineBench does not receive your Google, GitHub, Discord, or X password. If you choose social sign-in, that provider shares the identity and profile information covered by the permissions shown during sign-in.

Do not submit personal, confidential, or sensitive information in prompts or files unless the applicable interface and agreement expressly permit it.

## API Credentials and Model Providers

API credentials entered in Sandbox are stored in your browser's local storage. They pass through MineBench's server with a generation request and are sent to the model provider or custom endpoint you select. For saved generations, MineBench temporarily encrypts the required credential while the job is processed and deletes it when processing ends.

For limited hosted generation offers, MineBench may supply the provider credential instead. The prompt, generation settings, and model output are still processed by OpenRouter and the underlying model provider.

The selected provider processes prompts and related information under its own terms and privacy practices. You can remove saved credentials through Sandbox settings or by clearing MineBench site data in your browser.

## Cookies and Analytics

MineBench uses:

- `mb_session` to identify a public voting session, prevent duplicate votes, and measure recent activity for moderation;
- `mb_rls` for rate limiting and abuse prevention;
- `mb-theme` to remember your display preference;
- Supabase authentication cookies to keep signed-in users authenticated; and
- browser local storage to remember Sandbox credentials you choose to save.

The Arena cookies may remain for up to one year. They are not used for advertising.

Arena vote requests create restricted operational logs that may contain the vote's opaque identifier, choice, IP address, user agent, authentication status, and IP-derived location. MineBench uses these records to investigate manipulation and enforce rate limits or temporary blocks. IP-derived location is approximate and is not device GPS data.

MineBench also keeps a restricted activity record with the pseudonymous session identifier, optional signed-in account association, latest activity time, coarse city, region, and country, and a one-way IP abuse-prevention HMAC. The activity record does not store the raw IP address and is scheduled for deletion after 30 days.

MineBench uses Vercel Web Analytics for aggregate usage and performance measurement. Vercel Web Analytics does not use third-party analytics cookies or provide MineBench with a persistent cross-site identity. Its visitor-identification hash expires after 24 hours. MineBench's custom analytics events are limited to reliability and performance information and are not intended to contain prompts, API credentials, or direct identifiers.

## How MineBench Uses Information

MineBench uses information to:

- provide Arena voting, rankings, Sandbox generation, exports, and evaluations;
- calculate ratings and evaluation metrics;
- provide personal rankings based on votes associated with an account;
- authenticate users and manage organization access;
- prevent duplicate voting, abuse, fraud, and security incidents;
- maintain and improve reliability and performance;
- provide support and communicate about the service;
- administer evaluation and business agreements; and
- comply with law and protect MineBench, its users, and participating organizations.

MineBench may create and use aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be associated with an individual or participating organization.

## Public Evaluations

MineBench publishes public model identities, leaderboard results, rankings, vote totals, and related aggregate statistics. MineBench may publish or share aggregated or de-identified data from public evaluations for transparency, reproducibility, and research.

MineBench does not attempt to reidentify data it has released as de-identified.

## Private Evaluations

MineBench conducts private evaluations for model providers, research labs, developers, and other organizations. Private evaluations compare unreleased models, checkpoints, or configurations under confidential codenames, using provider-uploaded cohorts or private model endpoints and either public or invited evaluators.

Private evaluation data may include model identities, prompts, outputs, uploaded cohorts, builds, votes, feedback, endpoint information, credentials, durable processing status, metrics, reports, and security records. MineBench uses this information only to provide, secure, support, analyze, and report the applicable evaluation, follow the participating organization's instructions, and comply with law.

Unless the participating organization authorizes it in writing, MineBench does not:

- reveal confidential model or checkpoint identities;
- publish private results on a leaderboard or in a dataset;
- provide private evaluation data to another customer;
- use private evaluation data to train an AI model;
- allow a third-party model provider to use it to train or improve an unrelated model; or
- use private evaluation data for advertising or promotion.

MineBench shows evaluators model outputs and confidential codenames only as necessary to conduct an evaluation. Evaluators are informed that their votes and feedback are provided to the sponsoring organization. The organization controls whether and when its identity, model identity, results, or evaluation materials are made public.

Access is limited to authorized organization members, MineBench personnel, evaluators, and service providers that need the information to perform the evaluation. Credentials and secrets are excluded from organization reports, evaluator-facing surfaces, exports, and public results.

For endpoint-generated private evaluations, MineBench encrypts a checkpoint endpoint credential while building the evaluation cohort. Generation may continue after an organization user closes the browser because progress is processed and stored server-side. MineBench disables or deletes the stored credential when the cohort completes, the credential is revoked, or the evaluation closes. Arena voters receive stored MineBench build artifacts; their browsers do not connect to the private checkpoint endpoint.

Evaluation agreements and data processing addenda set additional protections, retention terms, and instructions. If an agreement conflicts with this Privacy Policy regarding private evaluation data, the agreement controls.

## How MineBench Shares Information

MineBench may share information with:

- service providers for hosting, database, storage, analytics, authentication, security, communications, or support;
- Google, GitHub, Discord, or X when you choose that provider to sign in;
- AI providers and custom endpoints selected by you or required for an evaluation;
- evaluation sponsors receiving results and feedback from an evaluation they commissioned;
- professional advisers such as attorneys, accountants, auditors, and insurers;
- authorities when required by law or reasonably necessary to protect rights, safety, or the service; and
- participants in a financing, acquisition, reorganization, or transfer of MineBench, subject to appropriate confidentiality protections.

MineBench may also share information at your direction or with your consent. MineBench does not sell personal information or share it for cross-context behavioral advertising.

## Retention and Security

MineBench retains information only as long as reasonably necessary to provide the service, maintain benchmark integrity, meet contractual commitments, resolve disputes, protect the service, and comply with law.

Contact-form submissions and optional reply addresses remain in MineBench's support mailbox only as long as reasonably necessary to respond, keep an appropriate support record, and protect the service from abuse.

Sandbox credentials remain in your browser until you remove them or clear site data. Arena vote and session records may be retained to reproduce rankings and investigate manipulation. Unless an evaluation agreement states otherwise, private evaluation data is deleted from active systems within 30 days after closure, final delivery, or termination and may remain in backups for up to 90 additional days. Private endpoint credentials are deleted or disabled when revoked, when a cohort completes, or when the evaluation ends.

Account records are retained while the account is active and as reasonably necessary afterward for security, legal, and benchmark-integrity purposes. If an account is deleted, MineBench may retain its public votes without the account association so historical aggregate rankings remain reproducible. IP-linked operational logs follow the retention available in MineBench's restricted logging systems and are not intended as permanent research records.

MineBench uses reasonable technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, or disclosure. No internet service can guarantee absolute security.

## International Processing

MineBench operates from the United States and uses providers that may process information in the United States and other countries. Where required, MineBench addresses international transfers through applicable provider terms, evaluation agreements, or data processing addenda.

## Your Rights

Depending on where you live, you may have the right to access, correct, delete, or obtain a copy of personal information; object to or restrict processing; withdraw consent; appeal a denied request; or complain to a privacy regulator. MineBench will not discriminate against you for exercising an applicable privacy right.

MineBench may need to verify your identity before completing a request. Because public Arena voting is pseudonymous, MineBench may be unable to associate a session record with you if you no longer have its session identifier.

Where European data-protection law applies, MineBench relies on contract, legitimate interests, consent, or legal obligations as appropriate. Where MineBench processes information on behalf of an organization, the applicable evaluation agreement or data processing addendum defines the parties' roles.

To exercise a privacy right, use the contact information below with the subject "MineBench Privacy Request."

## Children

MineBench is not directed to children under 13, or a higher minimum age where required by local law. If you believe a child provided personal information in violation of applicable law, contact MineBench to request its deletion.

## Changes to This Policy

MineBench may update this policy to reflect changes in the service, data practices, or law. The date above identifies the latest version. MineBench will provide any notice or consent required by law or contract before a material change applies.

Changes to this policy do not override an existing evaluation agreement or data processing addendum.
