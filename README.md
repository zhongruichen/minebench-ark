<h1 align="center">MineBench</h1>

**A benchmark for evaluating AI spatial reasoning through Minecraft-style voxel construction.**

Models are given a natural-language prompt and must produce raw 3D coordinates as JSON. In tool mode, models call `voxel.exec` (minimal primitives: `block`, `box`, `line`) to generate large builds beyond token-only JSON limits. MineBench visualizes the output and ranks models from blind head-to-head votes using a global Bradley-Terry model with uncertainty intervals.

> [!Note]
> MineBench is not technically a 'benchmark' as it has no objectively correct answers; it is a take on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132">LMSYS Chatbot Arena</a>. Many use MineBench to get the general feel or "vibe" of a model. AI labs may use MineBench to privately A/B test model checkpoints.

## Why MineBench?

Most LLM benchmarks test text and raw accuracy. MineBench instead tests whether a model can reason about 3D space. Given a prompt like "a medieval castle with four towers", the model must mentally construct geometry, pick materials, and output thousands of precise block coordinates. No vision model or diffusion – just math and spatial logic.

As it turns out, this kind of spatial reasoning correlates strongly with a model's raw general intelligence; the MineBench leaderboard tracks, anecdotally, the same hierarchy that most people observe in real-world usage: the smartest reasoning models are clearly visible when asked to produce visual builds.

MineBench, unlike other benchmarks, gives an easy way to visually determine (at least one aspect of) a model's raw intelligence. The ranking system also highlights which models are clearly 'bench-maxed' (i.e. when a model has amazing benchmarks on paper, but clearly lacks in real world usage).

## Quick Start (Local)

This path lets you run the full app and compare existing builds from `uploads/` without generating new ones.

Prereqs: Node.js `18+`, `pnpm`, Docker.

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm dev:setup
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
pnpm prompt --import
```

Then open:

* `http://localhost:3000/` (Arena)
* `http://localhost:3000/sandbox`
* `http://localhost:3000/leaderboard`

For environment variables, live generation, seeding/import workflows, batch generation, API routes, troubleshooting, and deployment, see the docs:

* [`docs/local-development.md`](docs/local-development.md)
* [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md)
* [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md)
