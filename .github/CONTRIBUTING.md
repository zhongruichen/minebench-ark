# Contributing to MineBench

Thanks for your interest in contributing to MineBench! This document covers how to get started.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Follow the [Quick Start](README.md#quick-start-local) instructions to set up the dev environment
4. Create a new branch for your work

## Ways to Contribute

### Add a New AI Model

See [Adding a Model](../docs/adding-a-model.md) for every surface a model
touches, from the catalog entry through benchmark generation and tests. A new
provider also needs an adapter in `lib/ai/providers/`, following the pattern of
`openai.ts` or `anthropic.ts`.

### Submit New Benchmark Prompts

Good benchmark prompts test spatial reasoning in interesting ways. To add prompts:

1. Run `pnpm prompt --init --prompt your-slug --text "Your prompt description"`
2. Generate builds for the prompt using available models
3. Submit a PR with the prompt folder under `uploads/`

### Improve the Frontend

The UI is built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js. Improvements to the 3D viewer, voting experience, or overall design are welcome.

### Add an Export Format

Build export formats live under `lib/voxel/export/` and are called from the browser worker in `components/voxel/voxelBuildExport.worker.ts`.

When adding a format:

1. Reuse the validated `VoxelBuild` shape and palette block IDs.
2. Keep conversion lazy and worker-backed so Arena and Sandbox rendering stay responsive.
3. Preserve block identity through native block states, material names, or metadata.
4. Add artifact checks to `tests/integration/voxel-export.test.ts`.
5. Update `docs/voxel-exec-raw-output.md` with import steps and format limits.

### Fix Bugs or Improve Documentation

Bug fixes and documentation improvements are always appreciated. Check the [open issues](https://github.com/Ammaar-Alam/minebench/issues) for things to work on.

## Development Workflow

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# start dev environment (resets DB, runs migrations, starts dev server)
pnpm dev:setup

# seed the database with existing builds
pnpm prompt --import

# run tests
pnpm test

# run the full local gate
pnpm check
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Include a clear description of what the PR does and why
- Make sure `pnpm check` passes before opening a merge-ready PR
- Test your changes locally before submitting
- If adding a new model provider, include sample output in the PR description

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:

- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Browser and OS information (for frontend issues)
- Relevant console output or error messages

## Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for linting (`pnpm lint`)
- Regression tests live under `tests/` and run with `pnpm test`
- Keep comments brief and informal
